# SampleURLs
A collection of various URI sample sets:

## [HTTP Archive](http://httparchive.org)
The HTTP Archive was created to compliment the Internet Archive.

From its [mission statement](http://httparchive.org/about.php): "In addition to the content of web pages, it's important to record how this digitized content is constructed and served. The HTTP Archive provides this record. It is a permanent repository of web performance information such as size of pages, failed requests, and technologies utilized."

All data is [publicily available](http://httparchive.org/downloads.php) and the project is [open source](https://github.com/HTTPArchive/httparchive).

Extracted URIs from its April 15, 2017 crawl: 6,657,856

## [Older Alexa Fourtune500 AddClick](https://github.com/HTTPArchive/httparchive/tree/master/lists)
